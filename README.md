# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early detection plays a critical role in ensuring effective treatment. This project leverages machine learning techniques to develop predictive models capable of identifying the likelihood of breast cancer based on diagnostic data.

Key features of this project include:

Use of Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest algorithms for classification tasks.
Application of data preprocessing and feature engineering to enhance model accuracy.
Performance evaluation through metrics like accuracy and precision.

The workflow for this project includes the following steps:

Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values.
Feature scaling and normalization.
Encoding categorical labels.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Statistical analysis of features.
Visualization of data distributions and correlations.
Model Development

Training and testing multiple machine learning models.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation

Comparing models based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
